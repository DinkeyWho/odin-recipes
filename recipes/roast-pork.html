<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  Never trust the exterior! This dish looks like a big chunk of roast pork on
  the outside, but its mostly <strong>POTATOES</strong>
</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>6 White potatoes</li>
  <li>3 Eringi mushrooms</li>
  <li>2 Packs of thick-cut bacon</li>
  <li>1 Large white onion</li>
  <li>1 Sprig of rosemary</li>
  <li>1 Sprig of parsley</li>
  <li>2 Tbsp / 30ml of soy sauce</li>
  <li>2 Tbsp / 30ml of butter</li>
  <li>1 Cup / 250ml of red wine</li>
  <li>1/4 Cup / 60ml of sake (Sweet)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Peel the Potatoes</li>
  <li>
    Slice the Potatoes
    <br />- Wash the potatoes then cut them into quarters or halves, depending
    on size.
  </li>
  <li>
    Chop the Mushrooms and Onions into Equally-sized Brunoise (small 5-6cm
    cubes)
  </li>
  <li>
    Steam the Potatoes
    <br />- Steam potatoes until soft (about 15-20 minutes). <br />- DO NOT
    steam or microwave the mushrooms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pan Fry the Onions and Mushrooms
    <br />- Prep the pan with a tablespoon of butter. <br />- Pan fry onions and
    mushrooms until caramelized or fully golden.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mash the Potatoes
    <br />- Mash into small chunks in a large bowl. Do not mash too much, you
    want to avoid it being frothy to form it to shape.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combine the Onion and Mushroom Mix with the Potato Mash
    <br />- Mix until the ingredients are even in the bowl.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pick the Rosemary
    <br />- Pick the rosemary off its stem. <br />- Set aside.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the Salt
    <br />- Add a few sprinkles of salt to the top of the bowl.
  </li>
  <li>
    Form the Fake Roast <br />- Let the mix cool until touchable (more than 5
    minutes). <br />- Take all of the mix and form it into a log shape.
  </li>
  <li>
    Wrap the Roast in Bacon <br />
    - Amount: 2 packs of thick-cut bacon. <br />
    - Wrap the roast fully, try not to leave any gaps, otherwise, the potatoes
    will seep out when the bacon tightens. <br />
    - There is no surefire way of doing this, just coat it to the best of your
    ability.
  </li>
  <li>
    Step 12: Tie the Roast <br />- Tie the roast with the twine. It does not
    need to be anything fancy, just wrap it around a few times. <br />
    - Intertwine the rosemary afterward.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bake in the Oven <br />
    -Bake at 375ºF or 190ºC for 30-45 minutes or until bacon is golden (cook
    longer for crispy bacon), turning halfway.
  </li>
  <li>
    Boil the Wine In the Frying Pan <br />
    -Amount: 1 Cup, or 250ml. <br />
    -Bring the wine to a boil (~10 minutes) on medium-high heat in a frying pan.
    The aim is to reduce it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the Butter, Sake, and Soy Sauce to the Wine <br />
    -Amount: 1 tbs of butter, 1/4 cup of sake, 2 tbs of soy sauce. <br />
    -Melt the butter into the boiling wine. <br />
    -Pour the soy sauce and sake into the sauce. <br />
    -Continue to cook for 2-3 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove the Twine and the Rosemary <br />
    -When the baking is done, remove the twine and rosemary, they are not to be
    eaten.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pour the Sauce on the Roast <br />
    -Pour the finished sauce onto the roast (make sure the roast is on a plate
    to hold the extra sauce). Pour slowly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the Garnish <br />
    -Add a garnish to the top of the dish, we used parsley, the anime used
    watercress.
